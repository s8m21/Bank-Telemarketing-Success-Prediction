1) Compared performance of various DSS-based models to determine potential subscribers for future campaigns. <br>
2) Gradient boosting algorithm was used to iteratively select a set of features for tuning and regularization, which improved its ability to generalize and prevented        overfitting. <br>
3) XGBoost model achieved the highest testing balanced accuracy, with an average of 87% <br>
